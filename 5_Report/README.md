# Report
In this project, we have learnt how to blink two LEDs with AVR ATmega328 microcontroller. First, we will connect the 2 LED’s with PB2 and PB3 of PORTB of the ATmega328 microcontroller. Then, we will make the 2 LED’s to blink with an interval of 1 second. It means, initially the 1st LED alone will glow and on the next second, it will turn off and the 2nd one will glow. This process continues forever and in this way LEDs blinks continuously.
In this, we have used 
* ATmega328 Microcontroller
* 3 resistors
* 330 Ohm Resistos-2
* 10 KOhm Resistor-1
* Reset Button
* Input Button
* Ground
* 2 LED's
